  shortDescription: Combatting Network Complexity Using Structural Sparsity
  fullDescription:
    markdown: |
      CONCUSS is a Python software tool for large scale graph analytics whose efficiency and scalability come from
      exploiting the underlying "structural sparsity" of the data. Current modules use low-treedepth colorings
      (guaranteed in graph classes of bounded expansion) and allow users to count the number of occurrences of a
      specific pattern within a graph (i.e. subgraph isomorphism counting).

  shortDescription: Bounded Expansion Algorithm Visualizer
  fullDescription:
    markdown: |
      BEAVr is a Python tool offering interactive visualization of the algorithmic pipeline for counting subgraph
      isomorphisms in graph classes of bounded expansion, as implemented in CONCUSS. BEAVr visually represents the data
      transformations and information in each stage of the pipeline (p-centered colorings, tree-depth decompositions,
      dynamic programming with k-patterns, and final counts via inclusion-exclusion). For researchers, BEAVr also
      enables exploration of new coloring heuristics via detailed visualization of each step of the coloring stage.

  shortDescription: Integrated Network Decompositions & Dynamic programming for Graph Optimization
  fullDescription:
    markdown: |
      The INDDGO software package offers a set of tools for finding exact solutions to graph optimization problems via
      tree decompositions and dynamic programming algorithms. Currently the C++/MPI framework offers serial and
      parallel (distributed memory) algorithms for finding tree decompositions and solving the maximum weighted
      independent set problem. The parallel dynamic programming algorithm is implemented on top of the MADNESS
      task-based runtime. This software is no longer under active development.
