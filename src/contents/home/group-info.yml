    Our group combines expertise in <i>structural graph theory, efficient algorithms, and generative network models </i>
    with tools from geometry and statistics to address <i>fundamental questions in data-driven science</i>.

    Most of our current research focuses on improving the understanding of <i>intermediate-scale network structure</i>,
    and using it to develop new <i>efficient (parameterized) algorithms</i> for rigorous, robust comparison, anomaly detection,
    sampling, and feature approximation in <i>real-world graph data</i>.
