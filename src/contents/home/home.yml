    > In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is. -Yogi Berra

    Our group combines expertise in _structural graph theory, efficient algorithms, and generative network models_
    with tools from geometry and statistics to address _fundamental questions in data-driven science_.

    Most of our current research focuses on improving the understanding of _intermediate-scale network structure_,
    and using it to develop new _efficient (parameterized) algorithms_ for rigorous, robust comparison, anomaly detection,
    sampling, and feature approximation in _real-world graph data_.
